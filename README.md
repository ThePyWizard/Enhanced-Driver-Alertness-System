# Enhanced Driver Drowsiness Detection System

**Driver drowsiness and unease pose a grave threat to road safety. Each year, fatigue-related accidents result in injuries and fatalities. We aim to develop an advanced drowsiness detection system capable of swiftly and precisely identifying sleepy or distracted drivers. This technology will integrate into vehicles, sending real-time alerts to fleet managers, ensuring immediate action. Furthermore, it will analyze drivers' sleep patterns and offer advice, promoting safer driving practices. The objective is not only to enhance road safety but also to explore new opportunities in the automotive and safety sectors. This project seeks to leverage technology for reducing accidents and saving lives.**
